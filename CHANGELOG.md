# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]

## [1.1.14]

### Changed

- Update dependencies.
- Update default runtime to node16.

## [1.1.13]

### Changed

- Acquire opam from GitHub release on Unix.

### Fixed

- Turn off git directory ownership check.

## [1.1.12]

### Fixed

- Stop installing `depext` package on macOS runners (opam is now at 2.1.0).

## [1.1.11]

### Changed

- Stop setting switch jobs variable on Windows (`OPAMJOBS` is sufficient).

## [1.1.10]

### Changed

- Run `brew update` before set up to avoid an issue with Bintray transition
  period.

## [1.1.9]

## Fixed

- Further fix to switch initialisation.

## [1.1.8]

### Changed

- The Windows opam wrapper is fractionally less-archaically named opam.cmd, with
  no loss in arcaneness.
- Export `CYGWIN_ROOT` on the Windows runners, allowing bash to be invoked as
  `%CYGWIN_ROOT%\bin\bash`/`$env:CYGWIN_ROOT\bin\bash` (and similarly for Cygwin
  `setup-x86_64.exe`).
- The Windows runner no longer prepends `%CYGWIN_ROOT%\bin` to `PATH`.

### Fixed

- Switches in Unix are now properly initialized before running depext.

## [1.1.7]

### Changed

- Ubuntu and macOS runners no longer display "No switch is currently installed."
  before building the compiler.
- Ubuntu no longer installs the system ocaml packages.
- macOS no longer builds two compilers on every run.
- Upgrade opam to 2.0.8 for Linux VMs.

## [1.1.6]

### Changed

- Windows installs Cygwin to `D:\cygwin`, using faster Azure temporary storage.

## [1.1.5] - 2020-12-15

### Changed

Reduce build time by exporting modified `OPAMJOBS` environment variable.

## [1.1.4] - 2020-12-07

### Changed

Windows installs `mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++` so GitHub Action can build libraries
that require it.

## [1.1.3] - 2020-10-23 [YANKED]

### Security

- Update the `@actions/core` package to address
  [CVE-2020-15228](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w).

## [1.1.2] - 2020-09-10

### Changed

- Add the Cygwin setup to a known location for later steps.

### Fixed

- Check if the switch exists before creating the switch.

## [1.1.1] - 2020-08-20

### Fixed

- OCaml installation errors on Windows are now properly propagated.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-07-04

### Added

- The default opam repository can now be set via input.

### Changed

- Linux VMs now use opam 2.0.7.

## [1.0.1] - 2020-04-21

### Changed

- `node_modules` are not exported anymore which reduces the size of the action

- The repository is initialised directly from the opam-repository git source, so
  that there is no lag in packages being available for CI

- Ubuntu installs `musl-tools` so that the GitHub Action can generate statically
  linked Linux binaries in conjunction with the
  `ocaml-variants.4.x.y+musl+flambda` switch

## [1.0] - 2019-11-21

- Initial release.
